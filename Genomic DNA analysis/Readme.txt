This is a custom code to trimm raw fastq reads in R and analyze alignment performed with Bowtie2 
You will be required to install R and RStudio (see instructions here https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2012/04/17/install-r-rstudio-r-commander-windows-osx/); R libraries ShortRead, Rsamtools, ggplot2 (run RStudio as administrator to install new packages); UNIPRO Ugene with embedded Bowtie2 (http://ugene.net/).

The fastq files that contain raw reads will be available in Short Read Archive (BioProject Accession: PRJNA552808).

You will need to have the reference genome sequence kd403-real.fasta and the files with coordinates of repeats in the KD403 genome "repeats_of_KD403" in the same folder as a fastq file
