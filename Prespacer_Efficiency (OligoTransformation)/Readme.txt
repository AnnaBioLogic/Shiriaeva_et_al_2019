In tis experiment BL21-AI strain transformed with pCDF-Ec.cas1/2 was electroporated with different pairs of oligonucleotides to test if they can work as prespacers.
"bl21de3.fasta" was used as a reference genome sequence. Use "pcdf_ec-cas12.fasta" as a reference sequence for the plasmid.


As a demo "G33_C33_OligoTransformation_Rep1" fastq file has been tested. Estimated run time of the first code "Spacer_extraction.R" is less than 1 min.  Estimated run time of the second code "Mapping_to_genome_plasmid_and_oligo.R" is less than 2 min. 
The expected output for this sample - a table "Oligo_derived_spacers" with 14 rows.
